# LibGuides

### Practical Web Development Test

This application makes use of Mississippi State Library's LibGuides API, which includes built in functionality for filtering and searching through API endpoints. This application is written in HTML, vanilla JavaScript and JQUERY. An AJAX request is used to make the request to the LibGuides API and handle the response. Bootstrap version 4.3.1 is used for styling.

## The application is fully responsive including XL, LG, MD and SM screens.

If you are not sure what you are looking for, hit the `search` button without inputing any other data to browse through all the guides available.

If you are looking for something more specific, you can search by

- Author full name (i.e. Julie Shedd)

- Author first or last name (i.e. Corinee, Lee, Zhang)

- Title (i.e. Literary Criticism)

- Guide type (i.e. Subject Guide)

- Guide ID (i.e. 577974)

- Keyword(s) (i.e. business)

The `date pickers` can be used to narrow down results based on publication date.

The `filter drop down` allows for filtering by name, hits (popularity), publication date, relevance.
